In rough order of priority:

- More sample testers.
- Animate things like adding new testers and open/close the About text, so it's.
  more clear where new testers appear and such.
- Make the CSS sufficiently responsive so that it's usable on an iPhone and
  such. Why someone would want to test regular expressions on an iPhone, I don't
  know, but why not?
- Allow the reordering of testers, either through dragging or clicking up/down
  arrows or something.
- Maybe find some way to create permanent links for testers, so that people can
  send regexes to others and they will open in a tester. This might require some
  server-side coding.
