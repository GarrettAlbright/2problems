In rough order of priority:

- Make the CSS sufficiently responsive so that it's usable on an iPhone and
  such. Why someone would want to test regular expressions on an iPhone, I don't
  know, but why not?
- Allow the reordering of testers, either through dragging or clicking up/down
  arrows or something.
