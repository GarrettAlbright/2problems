# 2problems.com

by [Garrett Albright](http://abweb.us/)

## Overview

This is the source code to [2problems.com](http://2problems.com), a
browser-based, JavaScript-powered regular expression tester. This is the result
of a complete rewrite of the first codebase for this site. If interested, the
code for the earlier version is
[available here](https://bitbucket.org/garrettalbright/2problems.com), but is of
lesser quality.

2problems' code has the following dependencies;

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), because jQuery is.
* [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org), a utility library.
* [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org), a library which provides models, views,
  and coâ€¦llections on the client side.

In the case of the latter two, they are implemented as Git submodules.
