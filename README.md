# 2problems.com

by [Garrett Albright](http://abweb.us/)

## Overview

This is the source code to [2problems.com](http://2problems.com), a
browser-based, JavaScript-powered regular expression tester. This is the result
of a complete rewrite of the first codebase for this site. If interested, the
code for the earlier version is
[available here](https://bitbucket.org/garrettalbright/2problems.com), but is of
lesser quality.

(Note that, as of this writing, 2problems.com is still using the older codebase.
If all goes well, this paragraph will be removed from this document soon.)

2problems' code has the following dependencies;

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), because jQuery is.
* [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org), a utility library.
* [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org), a library which provides models, views,
  and coâ€¦llections on the client side.

In the case of the latter two, they are implemented as Git submodules.
